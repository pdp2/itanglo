            </header>
            <p>A useful feature that tools like <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> and <a href="https://lesscss.org/">Less</a> provide is the ability to include CSS from multiple files and to compile it into a single file. It is possible to use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import">CSS imports</a> and surprisingly they do have good browser support, however, this would mean that you have to make a separate HTTP request for each import. For the sake of performance, it is usually considered best practice to reduce the number of requests as much as possible and tools such as the aforementioned CSS pre-processors allow us to benefit from the import syntax, whilst conveniently bundling the CSS into a single file. CSS pre-processors have many different features and seen as I am only interested in bundling for the time being, I thought I would have a stab and writing this functionality myself as part of the existing Deno build script.</p>
            <p>It makes sense that the CSS files should be bundled every time there is a change. The watch task is already setup to listen for changes in files in the src directory so I can hook on to this to run my CSS bundling code. I do need to make some changes though because I don't necessarily want all the build tasks to be performed when any of the files are changed. For example if an HTML file is changed I don't need to run the CSS bundler and if a CSS file is changed I don't need to run the code that creates the final HTML output. In the watch task there is already a <code>for await</code> loop that calls the build function everytime there is a change. The watcher is passed an event argument which also contains a property called <code>paths</code>. This will come in handy as I can pass it to the build function and in there I can check to see the type of file changed and run the appropriate code. The build function signature now looks like this:</p>
            <p><code>export default async function build(filesChanged)</code></p>
            <p>The <code>filesChanged</code> argument is an array of the paths of the files that have changed. In the opening lines of the function I use this array to determine what type of file triggered the change as shown below:</p>
<pre><code>let htmlChanged = filesChanged.some(file => file.indexOf('.html') > -1);
let cssChanged = filesChanged.some(file => file.indexOf('.css') > -1);</code></pre>
            <p>A bit further down there is a conditional statement that uses the latter of those variables to run a piece of code only if a CSS file has changed.</p>
<pre><code>if (cssChanged) {
    // Build CSS Styles
    const mainCssTargetPath = './docs/main.css';
    const mainCssFile = await Deno.readFile('./src/styles/main.css');
    const mainCssContent = decoder.decode(mainCssFile);
    const mainCssOutput = await parseCssImports(mainCssContent, filesChanged);

    await Deno.writeTextFile(mainCssTargetPath, mainCssOutput);

    console.log(`Created ${mainCssTargetPath}. \n`);
}</code></pre>
            <p>Most of the code is familiar and has been used in some other part of the build function. The addition is the <code>parseCssImports</code> function. This is similar to the <code>parseIncludeTags</code> in that it accepts the content of the file as a string and then parses it and returns the updated content string. In this case though rather than looking for include tags it looks for import statements and retrieves the relevant code for each of those imports and includes it in the content string. The difference being that the <code>parseCssImports</code> function is also passed another argument in the form of <code>filesChanged</code> which is the array of paths of the files that have changed. After looking at the code below you will see this is used to determine whether or not an import can be fetched from the cache or not. In order for the main CSS file to be updated successfully, I only want the imports for the files that have not changed to be fetched from the cache, otherwise the changes will never show. Here is the code for that:</p>
<code><pre>async function parseCssImports(content, filesChanged) {
    return new Promise(async (resolve) => {
        // Spread syntax converts to array because matchAll returns a RegExp String Iterator
        const importMatches = [...content.matchAll(/@import\s+'(\S+)';/g)];
        
        for (const match of importMatches) {
            const [importStatement, path] = match;
            const src = `./src/styles/${path}`;
            const cachedCssFile = cachedCssFiles.find(cssFile => cssFile.src === src);
            let cssFileContent;
            let useCachedFile = !!cachedCssFile;

            // Only use cached file if that file has not changed
            useCachedFile = filesChanged.every(file => file.indexOf(path.replace('./', '')) < 0);

            if (cachedCssFile && useCachedFile) {
                console.log(`Getting import: ${cachedCssFile.src} from cache. \n`);
                
                cssFileContent = cachedCssFile.cssFileContent;
            }
            else {
                console.log(`Reading import: ${src} from file. \n`);
                
                const cssFile = await Deno.readFile(src);
                
                cssFileContent = decoder.decode(cssFile);
                cachedCssFiles.push({ src, cssFileContent });
            }

            content = content.replace(importStatement, cssFileContent);
        }

        resolve(content);
    });
}</pre></code>
            <p>Similar to the <code>parseIncludeTags</code> function, a regular expression is used to match all the import statements. Next, I loop over the matches and as I mentioned earlier, if the CSS exists in the cache and it wasn't the file that was changed, I take the cached version, otherwise the content of the file is read and then pushed to the cache for next time.</p>

            <p class="postMeta">Posted by Paolo on Tue 31st Mar at 16:54</p>
        </header>
        <p>I thought it would be handy to have a watch task running while I'm making changes so that the build task is triggered when I change any of the files in the src folder. As part of the runtime API Deno includes the <a href="https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Deno.watchFs"><code>Deno.watchFs()</code></a> method that allows you to specify a folder or array of folders to watch. The method returns an <code>AsyncIterableIterator</code> that we can use with the <code>for await</code> syntax to handle any changes to the files in the specified folder. The code for the watch task is below:</p>
<pre><code>/* 
* This code should be executed using Deno.
* The command to do this is deno run --allow-read --allow-write watch.js
*/
    
import build from './build.js';

const dirToWatch = './src';
const watcher = Deno.watchFs(dirToWatch);

let waiting;

console.log(`Watching "${dirToWatch}" directory... \n`);

for await (const event of watcher) {
    // throttle events as multiple are fired when a file is changed
    if (!waiting) {
        waiting = true;
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(`${event.kind} ${event.paths.join(', ')} \n`);
            build();
            waiting = false;
        }, 1000);
    }
}</code></pre>
        <p>As with the build task, I have put a brief comment at the top to explain how to run the code with Deno. Following that, the first thing I do is import the build function which will be called everytime a change is detected. After setting up the watcher we can use <code>for await</code>  to iterate over the asynchronous change events. The <code>event</code> variable uses the <code><a href="https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Deno.FsEvent">FSEvent</a></code> interface, which contains a paths property that indicates the file/s that triggered the event. For some reason the watcher fires multiple events everytime there is a change, but I didn't want to trigger the build task for each one. To prevent this I added a throttle using the <code><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout">window.setTimeout()</a></code> method so the build task can only be triggered once per second.</p>
        <p>When I want to write a new post or make any changes to the files in the src folder, all I need to do is run the watch task before I start:</p>
        <p><code>deno run --allow-read --allow-write watch.js</code></p>

            <p class="postMeta">Posted by Paolo on Sat 27th Mar at 13:48</p>
        </header>
        <p>This was supposed to be a post about using Deno to build a main CSS file from multiple files, however, I
            somehow got sidetracked to building a watch task so that I didn't have to run the build task after every
            change and while I was doing that I realised that the posts in the index page were not in the right order.
            Oh well, at least I have ideas of what I can write about in the next couple of posts.</p>
        <p>In the previous post I wrote about my <q>great</q> idea to prefix each new post with a number with the theory
            that when Deno read them, it would be in the same order as they appear in the file system. That worked for
            the first 2 posts, but as soon as I added another post it broke. I guess that's an important lesson; test
            with more examples. I can still keep the prefix for convenience when I'm editing posts so that can easily
            find the latest one, however I decided to include a data attribute in post files so that I could use it to
            store the date. The opening article tag for the blog posts now looks like this:</p>
        <p><code>&lt;article data-article-date="2021-02-25T14:55"&gt;</code></p>
        <p>Now the build task can use the date value provided to sort the blog posts in a more reliable way. In the
            build task I had to make a change to the part responsible for building the post files. Previously as I built
            each post, I would push the content string to an array and then refer to this when building the index file,
            hoping that it would be enough to reverse sort the contents of that array in order to display the items in
            reverse chronological order. It wasn't. To make use of the date information, I extracted it using a regular
            expression and then put this into an object along with the content of the post (in a separate property) so
            that I could make use of it when building the index file. Here is what that part looks like:</p>
        <pre><code>// Build post files
const postsFilePaths = await Deno.readDir('./src/posts');
// Get dirEntry for each file in the posts directory
for await (const dirEntry of postsFilePaths) {
  // Read file and decode
  const fileName = dirEntry.name;
  const postFile = await Deno.readFile(`./src/posts/${fileName}`);
  const postContent = decoder.decode(postFile);
  const excerptContent = postContent.match(/&lt;article\s?\S+&gt;[\s\S]*&lt;\/article&gt;/)[0];
  const excerptDate = postContent.match(/data-article-date="(\S+)"/)[1];

  excerpts.push({
    excerptDate,
    excerptContent
  });

  const postOutput = await parseIncludeTags(postContent);
  // Regex below removes number prefix from file
  const postTargetPath = `./docs/${fileName.replace(/^\d+-/, '')}`;

  await Deno.writeTextFile(postTargetPath, postOutput);

  console.log(`Created ${postTargetPath}. \n`);
}</code></pre>
        <p>Now that each excerpt is an object containing the content and the date in separate properties, I can use this
            to sort the excerpts when it comes to building the index file. Below is the updated code that does this:</p>
        <pre><code>// Sort excerpts so that most recent post appears on top
excerpts.sort((a, b) => {
  const aTime = new Date(a.excerptDate).getTime();
  const bTime = new Date(b.excerptDate).getTime();

  if (aTime < bTime) {
    return 1; // sort b before a
  }

  if (aTime > bTime) {
    return -1; // leave a and b unchanged
  }

  // a and b are the same
  return 0;
});
// it is necessary to map the excerpts so the array contains only 
// content strings because the join method is used in a few lines
excerpts = excerpts.map(excerpt => excerpt.excerptContent);

indexOutput = indexOutput.replace('{{excerpts}}', excerpts.join(''));</code></pre>
        <p>As you can see I used the <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort"><code>Array.prototype.sort()</code></a>
            function to sort the excerpts in reverse chronological order. The function accepts a compare function as the
            first argument, and although I've used it before, I had to refer to the documentation again as I did find it
            a bit confusing. When adding the date information to the <code>data-article-date</code>, I ensured it was in
            a format that would be easy to create a <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date"><code>Date</code></a>
            instance from i.e. <code>2021-03-27T13:48</code>. I wanted the excerpts with the largest timestamps to be
            ordered first in the array because they represent the most recent dates. To get the timestamp for each date
            I used the <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTime"><code>Date.prototype.getTime()</code></a>
            method. The last thing I did before writing the content to the index file was to map the excerpts array so
            that it only contained the content strings, meaning I could use the <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join"><code>Array.prototype.join()</code></a>
            method to output all the content from the collection of sorted excerpts. That's all for today, thanks for
            reading.</p>

                    generator</a>
            </h2>
            <p class="postMeta">Posted by Paolo on Wed 17th Mar at 12:45</p>
        </header>
        <p>Rather than reaching for a ready made static site generator, I thought it would be an interesting excercise
            to
            try and build one myself. The main feature I was looking for was to be able to include common blocks of HTML
            such
            as a header or a footer. As the website grows, it becomes more tedious, not to mention more error prone, to
            manually update each file with any changes to these common areas.</p>
        <p>I reckoned <a href="https://deno.land">Deno</a> would be a good candidate for this sort of stuff, so I
            decided I
            would use this as an opportunity to learn more about it. To begin with I had a think about the file
            structure and
            where the generated files would go. This is what I came up with:</p>
        <pre><code>docs/
  hello-world.html
  index.html
  main.css
src/
  includes/
    footer.html
    header.html
  posts/
    1-hello-world.html
build.js
</code></pre>
        <p>In the root there is a <strong>docs</strong> directory, which will store all the files that will be served to
            the
            client browser. I am using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> to host my site so I could
            choose
            to keep the files either in the root or the docs directory, but I prefer to separate the files used to build
            the
            site from the public ones. The <strong>src</strong> directory contains all the files that are used to build
            the
            final public facing pages including the common re-usable blocks of HTML in the <strong>includes</strong>
            directory
            and the content of each post in the <strong>posts</strong> directory. The <strong>index.html</strong> file
            contains a list of all the posts. That leaves the <strong>build.js</strong> file which will contain the
            script
            that will be executed with Deno to build the website files.</p>
        <p>The Deno script will need to perform the following tasks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the files in the <strong>src/posts</strong> directory to get the content of the blog posts</li>
            <li>Store an excerpt of each post which will be used when building the index page</li>
            <li>Parse the content of each file and look for any <q>include</q> tags</li>
            <li>Read the files referenced in the include tags and replace the tag with the content from the file</li>
            <li>Finally build the index file using the include tags and the excerpts that were stored earlier</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you are familiar with running JS code with Node.js you will notice some differences with Deno. Below is an
            excerpt of the build.js file and in the comments you can see an instruction on how to run the program.</p>
        <pre><code>/* 
* This code should be executed using Deno.
* The command to do this is: deno run --allow-read --allow-write build.js
*/

console.log('Starting build task. \n');</code></pre>
        <p>After the run command you can see there are two parameters that are being passed; <code>--allow-read</code>
            and
            <code>--allow-write</code>. These are required because in Deno it is necessary to specify if a program
            should be
            granted access to perform operations that require certain permissions such as read and write. The idea is
            that
            this will improve security as it gives more control and visibility of what type of actions are performed to
            the
            user of the program. In it's current state the code will do little else apart from log to the console that
            the
            task has started. Below is another excerpt which illustrates the next step in the build process:
        </p>
        <pre><code>const decoder = new TextDecoder();
// Populated when creating post files
let excerpts = [];
// Cache include to avoid reading file again
let cachedIncludes = [];

// Build post files
const postsFilePaths = await Deno.readDir('./src/posts');
// Get dirEntry for each file in the posts directory
for await (const dirEntry of postsFilePaths) {
  // Read file and decode
  const fileName = dirEntry.name;
  const postFile = await Deno.readFile(`./src/posts/${fileName}`);

        <p>The first few lines in the excerpt above are declaring some variables which will be used later on. A bit
            further
            down you can see that I make use of the <a
                href="https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Deno.readDir"><code>Deno.readDir</code></a> to get a list of
            the
            resources in the ./src/posts directory. In reality what is returned is an <code>AsyncIterable</code>. Deno
            supports the <code>await</code> syntax for running asynchronous code and this is leveraged a few times in
            the
            example above. We can iterate through the different entries by using the <code>for await</code> statement.
            The
            value of the variable for each iteration uses the <a
                href="https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Deno.DirEntry"><code>DirEntry</code></a> interface.</p>
        <p>The <strong>name</strong> property is used to create a string representing the path of the file and this is
            passed to the <a href="https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Deno.readFile"><code>Deno.readFile</code></a>
            method,
            which returns a promise that resolves with a <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8Array">Uint8Array</a>.
            It's not really a data format I'm familiar with, but earlier on I created an instance of the <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder">TextDecoder</a> and using the
            <code>decode</code> method provided, we can turn this value into a string. Once the content is accessible in
            string form, I use a regular expression to grab the HTML article tag and all the content inside it and then
            I push
            this to the excerpts array so that I can use it later on when I get to building the index page.
        </p>
        <p>The next step is to generate the final output of the post. To do this the content is passed to the
            asynchronous
            <code>parseIncludeTags</code> function, which checks for the presence of tags that look like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>&lt;itanglo-include src="./src/includes/header.html"&gt;&lt;/itanglo-include&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>The value of the source attribute is used to read the file for this component and then the tag is replaced
            with
            the content in that file. I will cover this function in a bit more detail later in this post. Next, I remove
            the
            number prefix from the file name. The prefix is used so that I can easily sort the order the posts appear in
            when
            I put together the index file (again I will cover this when I talk about building the index file). I could
            leave
            it, but I think the URL of the post would look better without a number that wouldn't really mean anything to
            the
            reader. Finally I use the <a
                href="https://doc.deno.land/builtin/stable#Deno.writeTextFile"><code>Deno.writeTextFile</code></a>
            method to
            create the new post file. This is an asynchronous method, hence the <code>await</code> keyword before the
            invocation and it takes the file path as the first parameter and the file data as the second parameter.</p>
        <p>Building the index file is quite similar to the post files, except for there is only one source file. The
            index
            file will need to include a list of all the posts. For now this will include each blog post in full, but in
            the
            future I will look to make these actual excerpts. Below is the markup for the index source file:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;itanglo-include src="./src/includes/header.html"&gt;&lt;/itanglo-include&gt;
&lt;main&gt;{{excerpts}}&lt;/main&gt;
&lt;itanglo-include src="./src/includes/footer.html"&gt;&lt;/itanglo-include&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>In the index file there are include tags to bring in the common header and footer. In the main tag the
            <code>{{excerpts}}</code> syntax will be used by the build script to insert the list of blog posts. As I
            mentioned
            before, each post source file has a number prefix. The number represents the order the posts were written
            in, with
            1 being the oldest post and the highest number being the most recent post. With this system when we read the
            files
            in the src/posts directory they will be in chronological order and consequently so will the excerpts we
            captured
            earlier. Below is the code that builds the public index file:
        </p>
        <pre><code>// Build index page
const indexFile = await Deno.readFile('./src/index.html');
const indexTargetPath = './docs/index.html';
let indexContent = decoder.decode(indexFile);
let indexOutput = await parseIncludeTags(indexContent)

// Sort excerpts so that most recent post appears on top
excerpts = excerpts.reverse();

indexOutput = indexOutput.replace('{{excerpts}}', excerpts.join(''));

await Deno.writeTextFile(indexTargetPath, indexOutput);

console.log(`Created ${indexTargetPath}. \n`);</code></pre>
        <p>The first part is very similar to when we were building the post files, however after we have got the index
            output from parsing the include tags, I reverse the order of the excerpts so that the posts are listed in
            reverse
            chronological order, i.e. most recent on top, and then the <code>{{excerpts}}</code> syntax is replaced with
            the
            content of all the excerpts. Finally as with the post files the file is written with the
            <code>Deno.writeTextFile</code> method.
        </p>
        <p>All that remains now is to discuss how the <code>parseIncludeTags</code> function works. Below is the
            definition
            of the function:</p>
        <pre><code>/**
* Parses the content passed as the argument, checks for any include tags and replaces
* them with the content from the include file.
* 
* @method parseIncludeTags
* @param {String} content
* @returns {Promise} resolves with the updated content
*/
async function parseIncludeTags(content) {
  return new Promise(async (resolve) => {
  // Spread syntax converts to array because matchAll returns a RegExp String Iterator
    const includeTagMatches = [...content.matchAll(/&lt;itanglo-include src="(.+)"&gt;&lt;\itanglo-include&gt;/g)];
    
    for (const match of includeTagMatches) {
      const [includeTag, src] = match;
      const cachedInclude = cachedIncludes.find(include => include.src === src);
      let includeContent;

      if (cachedInclude) {
        console.log(`Getting include: ${cachedInclude.src} from include cache. \n`);
      
        includeContent = cachedInclude.includeContent;
      }
      else {
        console.log(`Reading include: ${src} from file. \n`);
        
        const includeFile = await Deno.readFile(src);
        
        includeContent = decoder.decode(includeFile);
        cachedIncludes.push({	src, includeContent });
      }

      content = content.replace(includeTag, includeContent);
    }

    resolve(content);
  });
}</code></pre>
        <p>The <code>parseIncludeTags</code> function accepts the content to be parsed as the only parameter and it
            returns
            a promise which resolves with the updated content. The main purpose of the function is to find include tags
            and to
            replace them with the relevant content. To begin with in the body of the promise function I use a regular
            expression to match all the include tags in the content and save them to the <code>includeTagMatches</code>
            variable. If you are wondering why I used the spread syntax this is because the <a
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/matchAll"><code>String.prototype.matchAll</code></a>
            method returns an iterator so the spread operator is used to put the resulting items into an array.</p>
        <p>There is another interesting statement that I used for the first time when writing this function and that is
            the
            <code>for … of</code> statement. I was looking for a reliable way of using the <code>async / await</code>
            syntax
            inside a for loop and then I found <a
                href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37576685/using-async-await-with-a-foreach-loop">this answer on
                stack
                overflow</a>. Inside the loop, first I check if the content of the include has been cached so that I can
            avoid
            having to read the file again. If it wasn't then the data is read from the relevant file, decoded and the
            content
            is added to the cache. Finally the include tags are replaced with the content and after the loop is finished
            the
            promise is resolved with the updated content.
        </p>
        <p>If you want to have a look at the code I have been referring to, you can see this in my <a
                href="https://github.com/pdp2/itanglo">GitHub repository</a>. Thanks for reading.</p>
