<h2>Experiment</h2>
<p>Posted by Paolo on 3rd October 2020</p>
<p>From what I remember, it was a regularly restless afternoon at work with a small recruitment company in London. I had felt for some time that I needed to make a change and I knew that, despite some appealing aspects, the recruitment industry was not for me. I did, and still do, enjoy speaking to people. It was rewarding to put a candidate forward for a role and for them to be offered an interview, and it was a privilege to be able to share some of the excitement when telling someone they got the job! So while there were parts of my job that I found interesting, I wanted to find a creative outlet. I got satisfaction from solving challenges and I was curious about the world of web design. I'm not even sure what it was that appealed to me about it, but I seemed to enjoy making things appear on the screen and I got a buzz to think that someone on the other side of the world could see it. At the time I wasn't really aware of the distinction between web design and web development. All I knew was that I wanted to learn how to make a website. At the time resources such as <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> and <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> were not around, so when I searched the web for "how to make a website", I found a book called <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/build-your-own-website-the-right-way-using-html-css-3rd-edition">Build Your Own Website The Right Way Using HTML &amp; CSS</a> by Ian Lloyd. From the very first page I was hooked. I loved the tone of the book and the project based approach to explaining the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. By following the examples in the book I was able to create a website for a fictitious diving club called "Bubble Under" and I was absolutely chuffed with myself.</p>
<p>Some time passed and I bought a few more books about CSS and learned new ways to layout web pages and it was fun. I started writing a blog and made a few different websites that never saw the fibre optic light of day. By that time I had moved to Reading, met my now wife and changed several sales related jobs along the way. I kept my personal blog going and it was a great place to experiment with the techniques that I was learning. At the time, when I wrote a new blog post, I used to share it on FaceBook for my friends to see. It was this very event that led to one of my friends reaching out to me and asking if I would be interested in a position at the company he worked for. The job was for a company called Perform, a sports media company who built and supported an array of websites mainly offering live video streaming of a variety of different sporting events. I remember going in for the interview with my CV and a handful of websites I had built to practice my skills. I was so nervous that my leg seized up and I literally had to hobble into the office for the interview. I had no commercial web experience at the time, but I think my enthusiasm got me through. I remember being terrified by JavaScript and completely flunking one of the questions which asked how I could display the date on the page using JavaScript. It didn't seem to be a showstopper, I showed that I was eager to learn and that I worked well in a team and that was more important. My wife and my 1 year old daughter waited patiently in the car and by the end of the interview I had been offered the job and I was ecstatic to be able to share the good news with them.</p>
<p>I joined the Live Technical Operations team at Perform and my commercial journey in web development had began. My job was to support the websites we created and could involve anything from fixing live issues that prevented customers from viewing their content, to making updates to the existing websites. It was tough, I had to learn an awful lot and relatively quickly, but I seemed to settle in well within the team and made some good friends. I carried on cultivating my passion for web development and I knew that I had to face my demon, which at the time was JavaScript. The old approach of picking up a book and working through it, didn't seem to be as successful, JavaScript was definitely a harder nut to crack. By that time more online video courses were becoming available and I watched countless hours of them and completed many different excercises, but it just didn't seem to click. It wasn't until I joined a digital agency called HeathWallace, that I really started to get a grasp on JavaScript, and that was in large part thanks to my manager at the time, Michael Nelson. His knowledge, enthusiasm and ability to explain programming concepts helped me to become proficient in writing JavaScript. Once again, I was hooked. The more I learned about JavaScript, the more I liked it, and more importantly the more I realised how much more there was to learn. I was introduced to Object Oriented programming and creating re-usable components, firstly with an in-house widget library and later with AngularJS. I had a little peep at some unit tests but didn't really get them or the value they added. I learned about Node.js and my mind was blown, JavaScript could run outside of a browser!</p>
<p>Angular started to take off and I was keen to get some more experience with it so I moved on to pastures new with Hitachi. That was my first experience of working within a big development team on a big budget project. I met some great people and learned more about working within an Agile team. I became accustomed to Angular and realised that JS frameworks needn't be as intimidating as I once thought. I started to like writing unit tests and learned how to use Karma and Jasmine. I realised how important they were this time and how many times they would help to avoid introducing bugs into the codebase. As things started to wind down at Hitachi, people started to leave and around that time my friend, Jon Frost, from the HeathWallace days, approached me about a job working with him at Yell. It was a good decision, I joined a cracking team of talented developers and people that really cared about their craft. I learned Vue.js, wrote more unit tests, with Jest this time and even wrote a Node.js and Express app.</p>
<p>So here it goes again. Another fresh start for my blog and it feels like the right time to do it. I want to have a bit of fun with it, think carefully about the tools and frameworks that I use and whether or not I actually need them. With each post I want to improve the blog in different ways, whether that's how it looks, a new piece of content or some sort of architecture behind the scenes. It's really an experiment and my intention with this blog is to document it every step of the way. As I write this, there are literally a handful of files in the code base including the home page, the page for this post and the .gitignore file. So it's basically just HTML, there aren't even any styles for now. With every commit I want to add little enhancements, that way it will be easy to go back in time and see the previous iterations of the blog. It should be interesting enough to keep me writing.</p>
