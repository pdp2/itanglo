<p>Posted by Paolo on 5th February 2021</p>
<p>I thought I would have a crack at creating a static site generator using Deno. My first attempt was a bit ambitious and I think I had taken on too many things at once. I decided to start again and concentrate only on including repeating blocks of HTML such as the header and the footer... <a href="./posts/deno-script-for-creating-post-pages.html">Read more</a></p>

<p><a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a> was released earlier this year and I thought I would have a quick play to get familiar with it.

I'm not sure why that is, because generally the consensus is that sans-serif fonts are easier to read on screens.

<p>From what I remember, it was a regularly restless afternoon at work with a small recruitment company in London. I had felt for some time that I needed to make a change and I knew that, despite some appealing aspects, the recruitment industry was not for me. I did, and still do, enjoy speaking to people... <a href="./posts/experiment.html">Read more</a></p>
